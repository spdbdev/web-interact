          <p>ðŸ’œ Content creators start a time-limited campaign (lasting 10 days, by default) with
            a goal, offering 1-on-1 interactions to fans (eg. play a game, chatting via Discord or Google
            Meet) that are scheduled in the 10 weeks (by default) after the campaign ends.</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ Fans try to be selected via the giveaway (with a free entry option) or the auction (be
            a top bidder on the leaderboard; pricier but a guaranteed interaction). Fans pay immediately
            for the giveaway; meanwhile in the auction, fans only pay if they win (charged at the end of
            the campaign).</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ When new fans try to enter the auction/giveaway, they have to create an account & input their
            general availability from Mon-Sun (editable on profile).</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ After the campaign ends, selected fans (winners) will have interactions assigned to them over
            the interaction window duration, 10 weeks by default (with auction winners having priority).</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ The content creator selects when they are available week-by-week (creators have to lock in their
            availability by Friday midnight (EST) for the next week, and can sync with their personal Google,
            Outlook or iCloud calendars); from this, with our matching algorithm, interactions are scheduled.

          <p>ðŸ’œ Form a closer bond with your fans who have been in your corner, cheering you on as you continue to
            grow as a creator & a human; everyone also gets to see the fan-interactions produced (or highlights)
            where they can learn more & see a different side to you.</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ Meeting your most loyal fans is fun & fulfilling. Itâ€™s a wonderful feeling to see their eyes light up.
            These arenâ€™t tedious requests nor formal lessons; there are no restrictionsâ€”you have complete
            freedom & control to stop talking to users and kick them at your discretion. Just chill with your
            fans on your own schedule.</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ Do it all with minimal effort & complete control: our scheduling algorithm is focused on flexibility
            for the creator; one only has to input their specific availability week-by-week, 3 days in advance
            (on Friday at the latest, week starts on Monday).

          <p>ðŸ’œ Maximize profits with Interactâ€™s hybrid giveaway + auction campaign. Our special automated auction
            bidding allows affluent fans to support the creator much more & gives a 100% success-rate option to fans
            (for fairnessâ€™ sake); it's the premium option as auction interactions are scheduled to occur first.
            On the other hand, any fan can enter the giveaway for free or spare a few dollars to buy 1 VIP entry to
            the giveaway (VIP = 25x increased chance, max of 1 per user); </p>
          <p>ðŸ’œ For a small-medium influencer who has 1000 fans willing to buy the VIP entry for $3 in the giveaway
            for a ~3.5% chance of winning an interaction (assuming 10,000 free entries & 50 interactions in the giveaway):
            $3K. Plus 50 interactions sold in the auction, which can add another $2K to $4K if each interaction sells for
            an average of $40 to $80, respectively. So thatâ€™s a total of <span style={{ backgroundColor: 'yellow' }}>$5K to $7K gross raised from one campaign
            selling 100 interactions with 1050 fans supporting you monetarily.</span> If the average interaction 30 minutes,
            thatâ€™s around 5 hours a week of fan interaction over 2 months (only one or two interactions a day or one
            evening per week); this is effectively being paid an extra $100 to $140 per hour while streaming/creating
            additional content while getting to meet & chill with your devoted fans. In a year, if a creator launches
            5 of these campaigns that reserve interactions for 2 months at a time (10 months of interactions), thatâ€™s
            <span style={{ backgroundColor: 'yellow' }}>an additional $25K to $35K gross revenue annually.</span>

      question: 'Why do fans want personal interactions?',
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>
            ðŸ’œ Most fans can only afford spending a few dollars (canâ€™t afford expensive merch & shipping); but, they
            donâ€™t have a compelling reason to give you some coffee money. Having a chance to personally interact & gain
            recognition from you is an attractive incentive (via the giveaway):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fans like youâ€”as social platforms are so one-sided, fans give you attention weekly or even daily without being
              able to receive any meaningful attention or recognition back. They treat you as someone they trust and/or a relatable
              friend, but have never been able to fulfill that relationship. Thus, fans want to be recognized by you & build a relationship
              by showing off their talents (e.g. best X-main in this game, astute questions & insights in X, musical/artistic talent,
              athleticism, or comedic genius).
            </li>
            <li>
              Fans want to discuss & make their own viewpoints known on subjects they are deeply passionate about, where youâ€™re one of the leaders
              in that subject/community (from anime to politics, from history to frontier tech, from reviews & tier lists to educational animations). 
            </li>
            <li>
              Fameâ€”if a fanâ€™s interaction was interesting, creators can post highlights of it or the interaction is part of a live-streaming/podcasting
              scenario where the fan is recognized by many fellow fans & viewers (react to content together, try not to laugh challenge, etc.
              even if you donâ€™t create that type of content yet, expand your varietyâ€”fans love to watch drama & discourse, or just something new).
              Interacting with fans as part of your content is effective & appealing since other fans are envious & garners large popularity (Mr. Beast,
              fans who donâ€™t make money are still ecstatic). Creating fresh content is one of the largest challenges we face, why not add some spice?

          <p>ðŸ’œ If youâ€™ve tried viewer games before, it was probably spontaneous (pulling users from stream chat),
            benefiting only users who are paying attention in those few minutes & are able to play at that time.
            Interact helps you & your fans plan ahead, organizing interactions with flexible scheduling (smart algo matching);
            this greatly increases demand since all fans have the opportunity to vie for an interaction via our unique
            auction + giveaway campaigns (moreover, Interact creates FOMO with 5-20 day
            campaigns + incentive to support you with a fun goal).

            Fans have interactions assigned to them in the 10 weeks (by default, or the Interaction window duration
            of your choice) after the campaign ends, where auction winners have interactions generally scheduled first,
            with priority over giveaway winners. The only thing a fan can control is their own general availability,
            as they wait to get matched with the content creator who locks in their schedule week by week, at the latest
            by Friday midnight for the upcoming week.

            unavailable timeslots automatically on your creator schedule tab (in your Interact profile page);
            after you lock in your availability for a week, your interactions with fans are scheduled
            and can be exported to your calendar.</p>
          <p>ðŸ’œFans can select their availability from Mon-Sun in general as long as they have an account, even before
            they've acquired any interactions (a minimum of 5 hours of the week have to be selected).
            Fans also select a preference for time of day (in their timezone), morning (6am to 10:30 am), noon (10:30 am to 1:30 pm),
            afternoon (1:30pm to 6pm), evening (6pm to 10:30pm), midnight (10:30pm to 1:30am), gremlin time (1:30 am to 6am).

            <li>The first week after the campaign (starting Monday) is when interactions will start to be booked.</li>
            <li>
              When the campaign ends, creators are shown the availability of all of their fans continuously (shown X number of
              fans that are available for each time slot), and release a specific schedule week-by-week on Friday midnight (11:59 pm EST)
              at the latest (except for the first week where creators have until Sunday midnight (11:59 pm EST) to lock in a schedule for
              the next week starting Monday), with the ability to choose how many interactions to do that week. We then allocate the best
              fitting fans as soon as the creator locks in their schedule for each week.
            </li>
            <li>Fans & creators can reschedule. Rescheduled fans will be added back into the matching algorithm pool & matched accordingly once again.</li>
            <li>
              By the last week, fans that creators are not able to meet are refunded. This means that if a fan or creator reschedules
              an interaction in the last week, the fan is refunded.

            their next giveaway with the same creator will have DOUBLE the chances of winning, stacking twice, 4x loss multiplier
            (meaning up to a total 4x chance for a free entry or a total 100x chance if it is a VIP entry; this only resets on

            ranked but matchmaking has toyed with your heart. Talk to me about your troubles, or ask questions, and Iâ€™ll answer your concerns
            while probably roasting you. Get to know me, and let me get to know my awesome fans; itâ€™ll be fun!<br />Of course youâ€™re also getting
            us closer to the goal of $5,000 where Iâ€™ll eat a spoonful of Da Bomb; the spice definitely exaggerated, Iâ€™m not worried.
