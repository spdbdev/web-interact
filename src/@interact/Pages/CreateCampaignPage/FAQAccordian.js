          All interactions are {data?.interactionDurationTime} minutes except
          for the top 3 on the leaderboard (from the auction) which get longer{" "}

      question: "How do I get an interaction?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          2 options: auction or giveaway. A max of 2 interactions per user can 
          be acquired from every campaign, one from the auction & one from the 
          giveaway; only 1 interaction is actually carried out, except the 
          duration is longer than a normal interaction (duration would become 
          the sum of the 2 interactions won, meaning if you place in the top 3 
          in the auction & you win in the giveaway, you get a super duper long 
          interaction). Auction: place a bid to be on the leaderboard or use
          auto-bid (select a max bid and your preferred ranking); if you are
          still on the leaderboard when the campaign ends, you will acquire an
          interaction. If you place in the top 3 on the leaderboard, your
          interaction will be longer in duration compared to a normal
          interaction. Only 1 bid is live at a time, each new bid replaces your
          previous one (meaning you can only acquire 1 interaction from the
          auction). Giveaway: Anyone can join the giveaway with a free entry or
          support a creator with a few dollars for a VIP entry that increases
          your chances of winning by 25x (but first, you have to correctly
          answer a skill based math question). Users can upgrade from the free
          to VIP entry (only 1 entry is allowed per user). Winners are drawn at
          the end of the campaign. Each time a user loses, their next giveaway
          with the same creator will have DOUBLE the chances of winning,
          stacking twice (up to 4x chance or a total of 100x chance if it is a
          VIP entry; this only resets on winning an interaction in the
          giveaway).

      question: "How does the giveaway work?",

          total 100x chance if it is a VIP entry; this only resets on winning an
          interaction in the giveaway).

    {
      question: "How do the auction & leaderboard work?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Place a bid to be on the leaderboard or auto-bid: We'll automatically
          bid the lowest amount to stay at your desired rank on the leaderboard
          until your max bid is reached. If others bid more & your max bid
          amount is exceeded, your rank will be lowered (we will automatically
          bid your max bid price if it is exceeded and still try to get you the
          highest rank possible); you might still be on the leaderboard or you
          might not be, meaning meaning no interaction (you'll be sent an email
          to increase your max bid). if you are still on the leaderboard when
          the campaign ends, you will acquire an interaction. If you place in
          the top 3 on the leaderboard, your interaction will be 2x or more in
          duration compared to a normal interaction. Only 1 bid is live at a
          time, each new bid replaces your previous one (meaning you can only
          acquire 1 interaction from the auction).
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "When can I interact?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Your interaction will be assigned in the {data?.interactionWindow}{" "}
          weeks after the campaign ends, where auction winners have interactions
          generally scheduled first, with priority over giveaway winners. You
          will be matched with the content creator’s weekly availability, which
          is usually released week-by-week. The only thing a fan can control is
          their own availability. You will be notified if you have an
          interaction during the next week at the latest by midnight on Friday.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How does scheduling work?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Your interactions can occur during any week during the date range of
          interactions, where auction winners have interactions generally
          scheduled first, with priority over giveaway winners. You will be
          matched with the content creator’s schedule, which is usually released
          week-by-week. Fans can select their availability from Mon-Sun in
          general as long as they have an account, even before they've acquired
          any interactions (a minimum of 5 hours of the week have to be
          selected). Fans also select a preference for time of day (in their
          timezone), morning (6am to 10:30 am), noon (10:30 am to 1:30 pm),
          afternoon (1:30pm to 6pm), evening (6pm to 10:30pm), midnight (10:30pm
          to 1:30am), gremlin time (1:30 am to 6am). The first week after the
          campaign (starting Monday) is when interactions will start to be
          booked. When the campaign ends, creators are shown the availability of
          all of their fans continuously (shown X number of fans that are
          available for each time slot), and release a specific schedule
          week-by-week on Friday 11:59 pm at the latest (except for the first
          week where creators have until Sunday 11:59pm to lock in a schedule
          for the next week starting Monday), with the ability to choose how
          many interactions to do that week. We then allocate the best fitting
          fans as soon as the creator locks in their schedule for each week.
          Fans & creators can reschedule. Rescheduled fans will be added back
          into the matching algorithm pool & matched accordingly once again. By
          the last week, fans that creators are not able to meet are refunded.
          This means that if a fan or creator reschedules an interaction in the
          last week, the fan is refunded.

          <Typography>
            Content creators start a time-limited campaign (lasting 10 days, by
            default) with a goal, offering 1-on-1 interactions to fans (eg. play
            a game) that are scheduled in the 10 weeks (by default) after the
            campaign ends. Fans try to be selected via the giveaway (with a free
            entry option) or the auction (be a top bidder on the leaderboard;
            pricier but a guaranteed interaction). Fans pay immediately for the
            giveaway; meanwhile in the auction, fans only pay if they win
            (charged at the end of the campaign, triggered manually, part of the
            firebase cloud function). When new fans try to enter the
            auction/giveaway, they have to create an account & input their
            general availability from Mon-Sun (editable on their profile page
            too). After the campaign ends, selected fans (winners) will have
            interactions assigned to them over the interaction window duration,
            10 weeks by default (with auction winners having priority). The creator selects when they are available week-by-week (creators have to lock in their availability by Friday midnight for the next week, and can sync with their personal Google, Outlook or iCloud calendars); from this, with our matching algorithm, interactions are scheduled.
