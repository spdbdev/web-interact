      <br></br>⭐ Meeting your most loyal fans is fun & fulfilling. It’s a

        When do fans interact?
      </Span>{" "}
      Fans have interactions assigned to them in the 10 weeks (by default, or
      the Interaction window duration of your choice) after the campaign ends,
      where auction winners have interactions generally scheduled first, with
      priority over giveaway winners. The only thing a fan can control is their
      own general availability, as they wait to get matched with the content
      creator who locks in their schedule week by week, at the latest by Friday
      midnight for the upcoming week.

      <Span sx={{ textDecoration: "underline", display: "block" }}>
        How does scheduling work?
      </Span>{" "}
      ⭐ You can sync with your Google, Outlook or iCloud calendar, where your
      scheduled events will show up as unavailable timeslots automatically on
      your creator schedule tab (in your Interact profile page); after you lock
      in your availability for a week, your interactions with fans are scheduled
      and can be exported to your calendar. <br></br>⭐ Fans can select their
      availability from Mon-Sun in general as long as they have an account, even
      before they've acquired any interactions (a minimum of 5 hours of the week
      have to be selected). Fans also select a preference for time of day (in
      their timezone), morning (6am to 10:30 am), noon (10:30 am to 1:30 pm),
      afternoon (1:30pm to 6pm), evening (6pm to 10:30pm), midnight (10:30pm to
      1:30am), gremlin time (1:30 am to 6am). <br></br>⭐ The first week after
      the campaign (starting Monday) is when interactions will start to be
      booked. <br></br>⭐ When the campaign ends, creators are shown the
      availability of all of their fans continuously (shown X number of fans
      that are available for each time slot), and release a specific schedule
      week-by-week on Friday 11:59 pm at the latest (except for the first week
      where creators have until Sunday 11:59pm to lock in a schedule for the
      next week starting Monday), with the ability to choose how many
      interactions to do that week. We then allocate the best fitting fans as
      soon as the creator locks in their schedule for each week. <br></br>⭐
      Fans & creators can reschedule. Rescheduled fans will be added back into
      the matching algorithm pool & matched accordingly once again. <br></br>⭐
      By the last week, fans that creators are not able to meet are refunded.
      This means that if a fan or creator reschedules an interaction in the last
      week, the fan is refunded.

      The giveaway allows all of your fans—for free or for a few dollars—to
      support you & achieve the campaign goal while getting a chance to interact
      with a content creator they love. <br></br>⭐ The auction makes it fair by
      giving your most loyal fans the option to get an interaction with 100%
      certainty; your most loyal fans who want to tell you, their favorite
      creator, about themselves will save up birthday money / holiday wishes for

      You must create a goal which is non-binding, i.e. interactions are still

      ⭐ Playing games (from competitive games like Valorant & Chess to….
      GeoGuessr or mini putt in Discord activities). <br></br>⭐ Discussing
      topics fans are passionate about, commentating, and learning from each
      other (fans can screen share: they might show off their own creations,

      <Span sx={{ textDecoration: "underline", display: "block" }}>
        <br />
        Why do fans want personal interactions?
      </Span>{" "}
      Most fans can only afford spending a few dollars (can’t afford expensive
      merch & shipping); but, they don’t have a compelling reason to give you
      some coffee money. Having a chance to personally interact & gain
      recognition from you is an attractive incentive (via the giveaway):
      <br></br>⭐Fans like you—as social platforms are so one-sided, fans give
      you attention weekly or even daily without being able to receive any
      meaningful attention or recognition back. They treat you as someone they
      trust and/or a relatable friend, but have never been able to fulfill that
      relationship. Thus, fans want to be recognized by you & build a
      relationship by showing off their talents (e.g. best X-main in this game,
      astute questions & insights in X, musical/artistic talent, athleticism, or
      comedic genius).
      <br></br>⭐ Fans want to discuss & make their own viewpoints known on
      subjects they are deeply passionate about, where you’re one of the leaders
      in that subject/community (from anime to politics, from history to
      frontier tech, from reviews & tier lists to educational animations).
      <br></br>⭐ Fame—if a fan’s interaction was interesting, creators can post
      highlights of it or the interaction is part of a live-streaming/podcasting
      scenario where the fan is recognized by many fellow fans & viewers (react
      to content together, try not to laugh challenge, etc. even if you don’t
      create that type of content yet, expand your variety—fans love to watch
      drama & discourse, or just something new). Interacting with fans as part
      of your content is effective & appealing since other fans are envious &
      garners large popularity (Mr. Beast, fans who don’t make money are still
      ecstatic). Creating fresh content is one of the largest challenges we
      face, why not add some spice?
