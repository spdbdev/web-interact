    question: <span>How it works</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        ðŸ’œ Content creators start a time-limited campaign (lasting 10 days, by default) with a goal, offering 1-on-1 interactions to fans (eg. play a game, chatting via Discord or Google Meet) that are scheduled in the 10 weeks (by default) after the campaign ends.
        <br></br>ðŸ’œ Fans try to be selected via the giveaway (with a free entry option) or the auction (be a top bidder on the leaderboard; pricier but a guaranteed interaction). Fans pay immediately for the giveaway; meanwhile in the auction, fans only pay if they win (charged at the end of the campaign).
        <br></br>ðŸ’œ When new fans try to enter the auction/giveaway, they have to create an account & input their general availability from Mon-Sun (editable on profile).
        <br></br>ðŸ’œ After the campaign ends, selected fans (winners) will have interactions assigned to them over the interaction window duration, 10 weeks by default (with auction winners having priority).
        <br></br>ðŸ’œ The content creator selects when they are available week-by-week (creators have to lock in their availability by Friday midnight (EST) for the next week, and can sync with their personal Google, Outlook or iCloud calendars); from this, with our matching algorithm, interactions are scheduled.

    question: <span>How much money can I make?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        ðŸ’œ Maximize profits with Interactâ€™s hybrid giveaway + auction campaign. Our
        special automated auction bidding allows affluent fans to support the
        creator much more & gives a 100% success-rate option to fans (for
        fairnessâ€™ sake); it's the premium option as auction interactions are
        scheduled to occur first. On the other hand, any fan can enter the
        giveaway for free or spare a few dollars to buy 1 VIP entry to the
        giveaway (VIP = 25x increased chance, max of 1 per user). <br></br>ðŸ’œ For a
        small-medium influencer who has 1000 fans willing to buy the VIP entry
        for $3 in the giveaway for a ~3.5% chance of winning an interaction
        (assuming 10,000 free entries & 50 interactions in the giveaway): $3K.
        Plus 50 interactions sold in the auction, which can add another $2K to
        $4K if each interaction sells for an average of $40 to $80,
        respectively. So thatâ€™s a total of{" "}
        <strong style={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>
          $5K to $7K gross raised from one campaign selling 100 interactions
          with 1050 fans supporting you monetarily.
        </strong>{" "}
        If the average interaction 30 minutes, thatâ€™s around 5 hours a week of
        fan interaction over 2 months (only one or two interactions a day or one
        evening per week); this is effectively being paid an extra $100 to $140
        per hour while streaming/creating additional content while getting to
        meet & chill with your devoted fans. In a year, if a creator launches 5
        of these campaigns that reserve interactions for 2 months at a time (10
        months of interactions), thatâ€™s an additional{" "}

    question: <span>Why interact with fans?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        ðŸ’œ Form a closer bond with your fans; either through those who support you
        monetarily and want an interaction or through the consumption of the
        fan-interactions produced, where everyone can learn more & see a
        different side to you. <br></br>ðŸ’œ Meeting your most loyal fans is fun & fulfilling.
        Itâ€™s a wonderful feeling to see their eyes light up. These arenâ€™t
        tedious requests nor formal lessons; there are no restrictionsâ€”you have
        complete freedom & control to stop talking to users and kick them at
        your discretion. Just chill with your fans on your own schedule.
        <br></br>ðŸ’œ Do it all
        with minimal effort & complete control: our scheduling algorithm is
        focused on flexibility for the creator; one only has to input their
        specific availability week-by-week, 3 days in advance (on Friday at the
        latest, week starts on Monday).
      </span>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: <span>Why do fans want personal interactions?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        Most fans can only afford spending a few dollars (canâ€™t afford expensive merch
        & shipping); but, they donâ€™t have a compelling reason to give you some coffee
        money. Having a chance to personally interact & gain recognition from you is
        an attractive incentive (via the giveaway):
        <br></br>ðŸ’œ Fans like youâ€”as social platforms are so one-sided, fans give you attention weekly or
        even daily without being able to receive any meaningful attention or
        recognition back. They treat you as someone they trust and/or a
        relatable friend, but have never been able to fulfill that relationship.
        <br></br> ðŸ’œ Thus, fans want to be recognized by you & build a relationship by
        showing off their talents (e.g. best X-main in this game, astute
        questions & insights in X, musical/artistic talent, athleticism, or
        comedic genius). Fans want to discuss & make their own viewpoints known
        on subjects they are deeply passionate about, where youâ€™re one of the
        leaders in that subject/community (from anime to politics, from history
        to frontier tech, from reviews & tier lists to educational animations).
        <br></br>
        ðŸ’œ Fameâ€”if a fanâ€™s interaction was interesting, creators can post
        highlights of it or the interaction is part of a
        live-streaming/podcasting scenario where the fan is recognized by many
        fellow fans & viewers (react to content together, try not to laugh
        challenge, etc. even if you donâ€™t create that type of content yet,
        expand your varietyâ€”fans love to watch drama & discourse, or just
        something new). Interacting with fans as part of your content is
        effective & appealing since other fans are envious & garners large
        popularity (Mr. Beast, fans who donâ€™t make money are still ecstatic).{" "}
        <strong style={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>
          Creating fresh content is one of the largest challenges we face, why
          not add some spice?

  },
  {
    question: <span>How is Interact different from viewer games?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        If youâ€™ve tried viewer games before, it was probably spontaneous
        (pulling users from stream chat), benefiting only users who are paying
        attention in those few minutes & are able to play at that time. Interact
        helps you & your fans plan ahead, organizing interactions with flexible
        scheduling (smart algo matching); this greatly increases demand since
        all fans have the opportunity to vie for an interaction via our unique
        auction & giveaway campaigns (moreover, Interact creates FOMO with 5-20
        day campaigns + incentive to support you with a fun goal).
